1) How to use the program
The controller class instantiates a new board.
The conrtroller has the main class and controls the GUI elements.

The main menu has a picture from the chracter peggy hill from king of the hill. She is a renowned boggle champion. The user should aspire to someone like her.
The main menu has a drop down menu for game mode selection that includes 4x4, 5x5, and egyptian boggle.
After the game mode is selected through the drop down menu, the start button should be clicked.
The user interface inside the game is simple enough. As buttons are clicked, letter buttons are disabled and lines are drawn between them as they are added
onto a text field. The enter button should then be pressed to check if the word is a valid entry or not. 

There is also a go back to main menu button to go back to main menu. Once clicked, the current seed of the board will forever be lost as the timer will be reset
and board will be shuffled right away.

The Egyptian mode is targeted towards western audiences so translation of the egyptian letters is done right away.

2) A list of any testing and/or debugging tools in the project and now to use them.
The only debugging tools including are print out statements and they only utilize the command line. 
Comment them out to exclude them from running.

3)Who did what parts of the program and what parts (if any) are by a third party
I, Mina Faltas, did 100% of the project.

4)A list of known bugs.

If game has started and the go back to main menu button was clicked then a new game was started, the new game is going to have a
 transparent image of another letter that will appear and disappear as buttons are clicked on.
